This project involved analysing a dataset containing sporadic daily numbers of new Covid cases and deaths throughout the world. 
I used python to clean up the data, then calculate each location's monthly total cases, case fatality rate, total deaths, new cases, and new deaths. I then created visualisations of my analysis.
This project was very engaging for me as it had obvious real world significance and was very topical. I gained insights through my studies about events that I had experienced
and applying my skills to current worldly issues.
